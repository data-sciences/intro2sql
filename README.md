Introduction to SQL scripts for SQLite

Note SQLite doesn't:
 support foreign keys
 only supports left joins (inner and outer)

To create the demo database, you need to create a database and then import and 
run the script m1.sql

You should be able to run these examples on other databases that support SQL.

The sqlite/ directory has a script to create and fill the tables for SQLite.

The ssmc/ directory has scripts to create the database and another to create
and fill the tables.

With the SSMS system (SQL Server Management Console)
