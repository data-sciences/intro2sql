Introduction to SQL scripts for SQLite

Note SQLite doesn't:
 support foreign keys
 only supports left joins (inner and outer)

To create the demo database, you need to create a database and then import and 
run the script m1.sql

You shold be able to run these examples on other databases that support SQL.
